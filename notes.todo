Todo:
  ☐ ModuleComponent: don't delete Components when hiding them
  ☐ Cache: cache resources for a day, add check when downloading 
  ☐ Multiple-Choice and the make random once thing,
    issue is we need to pass props down when user clicks an answer
    however once() just returns the original componen, which didn't know
    if answer was correct. Currently just use CSS which is "ok"
    Use a HOF type thing
